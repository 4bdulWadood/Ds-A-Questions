/*Notes:
The time complexity is the same as DFS—O(V+E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of connections between the nodes.

The space complexity is O(l), where l is the maximum number of nodes in a single level, need to decrease the width of the tree to improve efficiency. 

The continue keyword in JS can be used to break the current iteration of the loop.
